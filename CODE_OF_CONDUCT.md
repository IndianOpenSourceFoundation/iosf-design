Code of Conduct
===============

To be effective, the members of the IOSF community must work
together; our code of conduct lays down the "ground rules" for our
cooperative efforts.

At IOSF we have taken a pledge to make open source contribution simplified. Join us in our journey and let's create effective products on our way.

**Note - We have agreed upon the following Code of Conduct as a guide to our collaboration and cooperation.**

Be considerate
--------------

Your work will be used by other people in our community. Any decision taken by you can affect other users and colleagues. We expect you to take those consequences into account while making decisions. For example, when we are working with a new feature, please don't do anything that can affect the product directly.

Be respectful
-------------

IOSF community and its members treat one another with
respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to our organization. We may
not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and
poor manners. We all might experience some frustration now and then,
but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal
attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members
of our community to be respectful when dealing with other
contributors as well as with people outside our community too.

Be collaborative
----------------

Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free
Software world, and improves the quality of the software produced. You
should aim to collaborate with other IOSF contributors, as well as
with the entire community that is interested in the work you
do.

Be flexible
-----------

IOSF community and its members come from various backgrounds
and cultures. Be flexible with other community members in terms of communication.

When you are unsure, ask for help
---------------------------------

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in our community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road,
therefore, cross questioning is encouraged. Those who are asked should be
responsive and helpful.

Mailing lists and web forums
----------------------------

This code of conduct applies very much to your behavior in mailing
lists and web forums.

* Please watch your language.  IOSF community is a family-friendly place.
* Please use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.
* Please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments.
